Hello there !

So, recently I was like : Hey, why not have my puushs on my remote server so I can have them all the time without limitations and not on a server I didn't knew (the puush server).

After searching and a little bit of WireShark (awesome soft, I recommand it for packet analysing !) I did this little bit of php.

And I also add an aes256 encoding so you'll have urls like when you upload files with Mega.

(Sorry for the english, I'm french.)

/!\ This is for advanced users, I'm not responsible of anything you'll do with this.
puush is the entire property of it's original owners /!\

Thanks to Hidendra (https://github.com/Hidendra/puush-api) for the inspiration.

If you have any problems that aren't specific to my script, use Google before contacting or letting an issue.
Don't be shy and commit if you think you can add interisting edits in my code !

INSTALL :

	SERVER SIDE :

	- Copy all the files in a folder in your web folder (for example /var/www/i)
	- Create thumbs and uploads folders with chmod 777 on them in this folder
	- Edit config.php to change BASE_DIR constant to the directory you made before
	- Also change BASE_URL to the domain or subdomain you want your puush to be (for example i.yourwebsite.com)
	- Create a new SQL database, or use an existing one and use database.sql to create a puush table
	- Edit bdd.php constants (HOST, DATABASE, USER, PASS) so those logins fits the ones of your database
	- If you use apache, let the .htaccess like it is, if you're using nginx, copy the nginx rules (in nginx rules.txt) in your config file
	- Setup a vhost to accept requests at PUUSH.ME

	CLIENT SIDE :

	- Edit your local hosts file (C:\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows) to add the following line :

	XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX puush.me

	And replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX by your server IP
