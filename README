Hello there !

So, recently I was like: Hey, why not have my puushs on my remote server so I can have them all the time without limitations and not on a server I didn't knew (the puush server).

After searching and using WireShark a little bit (Awesome software, I recommand it for packet analyzing !) I made this little PHP script.

I also added aes256 encoding so you'll have urls like when you upload files with Mega.

(Sorry for the English, I'm French.)

/!\ This is for advanced users, I'm not responsible for anything you do with this.
puush is the property of its original owners /!\

Thanks to Hidendra (https://github.com/Hidendra/puush-api) for the inspiration.

If you have any problems that aren't specific to my script, use Google before contacting or creating an issue.
Don't be shy and commit if you think you can add interesting edits to my code!

INSTALL :

	SERVER SIDE :

	- Copy all the files in a folder in your web folder (for example /var/www/i)
	- Create thumbs and uploads folders with chmod 777 on them in this folder
	- Edit config.php to change BASE_DIR constant to the directory you made before
	- Also change BASE_URL to the domain or subdomain you want your puush to be (for example i.yourwebsite.com)
	- Create a new SQL database, or use an existing one and use database.sql to create a puush table
	- Edit bdd.php constants (HOST, DATABASE, USER, PASS) so those logins fits the ones of your database
	- If you use apache, let the .htaccess like it is, if you're using nginx, copy the nginx rules (in nginx rules.txt) in your config file
	- Setup a vhost to accept requests from/at puush.me (by editing ServerName or server_name)

	CLIENT SIDE :

	- Edit your local hosts file (C:\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows, /etc/hosts on Linux/MacOS) and add the following line:

	XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX puush.me

	And replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX by your server IP
